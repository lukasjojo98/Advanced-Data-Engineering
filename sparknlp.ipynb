You can geather, fish and hunt.\\n\\nGraphics: The graphics are amazing very fine and sharp which doesn't happen with most games.\\n\\nSound: The sound if wonderful although it sometimes is a little slow, but other then that it's really good.\\n\\nPros: Help ppl learn about different plants, fish and wild game.\\nIs really fun to play and it never gets old.\\nHas really cool short movies that you can watch over and over again.\\n\\nCons: For some reason the rattle snakes always try to kill me.\\nCan sometimes be a little tricky but if you bye the right stuff you will be fine.\\nThe disc got scratched up pretty easyly from just being in the Cd rom.\\n\\nOverall it's a good game that is good for ages 6 and up.|[pos] |\n",
